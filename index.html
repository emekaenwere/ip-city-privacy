NetSageStudios LLC (“we,” “our,” or “us”) operates the mobile application IP City (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.

1) Information We Collect
IP City does not require users to create an account or provide personal information such as name, email address, phone number, or physical address.

However, the App uses Google Firebase services which generate and process:

Anonymous User ID (UID): a randomly generated identifier used to enable app functionality and security. It is not linked to your name or email.
App Integrity & Security Data: such as app version, platform, package name, and integrity verification tokens used for security and abuse prevention.
2) How We Use the Information
We use data strictly for:

Enabling core app functionality
Verifying app integrity and preventing abuse
Security, fraud prevention, and compliance
We do not use data for advertising, marketing, behavioral tracking, profiling, or selling user data.

3) Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share user data with advertisers or third-party marketing companies. Data may be processed by Google Firebase (Google LLC) as part of backend infrastructure services.

4) Data Security
Data transmitted between the App and backend services is encrypted in transit using HTTPS (TLS). We implement reasonable safeguards to protect against unauthorized access or misuse.

5) Data Retention
Anonymous identifiers and security-related records may be retained as long as necessary to maintain functionality, prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations.

6) Children’s Privacy
IP City is not specifically directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

7) Your Rights
Because the App does not collect directly identifiable personal information (such as name or email), most data cannot be linked back to an individual user.

8) Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.
