# Privacy Policy for IP City

**Effective Date: February 26, 2026**

NetSageStudios LLC (“we,” “our,” or “us”) operates the mobile application **IP City** (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected when you use the App.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

IP City does not require users to create an account or provide personal information such as name, email address, phone number, or physical address.

However, the App uses Google Firebase services, which generate and process the following:

**Anonymous User ID (UID)**
A randomly generated identifier used to enable app functionality and security. This identifier is not linked to your name, email address, or other personally identifiable information.

**App Integrity and Security Data**
Information such as app version, platform type, package name, and integrity verification tokens. This data is used to ensure proper operation of the App and to prevent abuse or unauthorized access.

---

## 2. How We Use Information

We use collected data solely for:

* Enabling core app functionality
* Verifying app integrity
* Preventing fraud and abuse
* Maintaining security and compliance

We do not use data for advertising, marketing, behavioral tracking, profiling, or selling user data.

---

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share user data with advertisers or third-party marketing companies.

Data may be processed by **Google Firebase (Google LLC)** as part of backend infrastructure services. Firebase processes data on our behalf for the purpose of operating and securing the App.

---

## 4. Data Security

Data transmitted between the App and backend services is encrypted in transit using HTTPS (TLS).

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and security measures designed to protect information against unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure.

---

## 5. Data Retention

Anonymous identifiers and security-related records may be retained only as long as necessary to:

* Maintain app functionality
* Prevent fraud and abuse
* Comply with legal obligations

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

IP City is not directed toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If you believe that a child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Because the App does not collect directly identifiable personal information (such as name or email address), most data cannot be reasonably linked to an individual user.

If you have questions regarding data handling, you may contact us at:

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised Effective Date.
